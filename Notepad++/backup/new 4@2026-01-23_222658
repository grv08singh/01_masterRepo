#### Problem Statement:
You are a Data Scientist in a big firm. You have to develop a `deep learning model` to perform `sentiment analysis` on a dataset of `tweets` related to various candidates.

#### Tasks to be Performed:
##### 1) Data Loading and Preprocessing:
* __Load__ the `tweet` data from a `CSV file`.
* __Filter out__ the relevant columns: `candidate`, `sentiment`, and `text`.
* __Preprocess__ the text data by __removing__ `stop words`, `punctuation`, converting to `lowercase`, and other cleaning steps.

##### 2) Text Vectorization:
__Convert__ the preprocessed text data into numerical format using `tokenization` and `padding`, so that it can be fed into a deep learning model.

##### 3) Model Development:
__Develop__ a deep learning model using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`. The model includes an `Embedding` layer, a `SpatialDropout1D` layer to prevent overfitting, an `LSTM` layer for sequence data processing, and a `Dense` layer for output. It aims to classify the sentiment of each tweet into one of the three categories.

##### 4) Model Training and Evaluation:
* __Train__ the model on the processed text data, using `categorical cross-entropy` as the loss function, and `accuracy` as the evaluation metric.
* Use a `validation split` to __evaluate__ the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
